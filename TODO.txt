Modify this list with updated information.

* Defaults! And adjusting defaults and settings.
    * Grid size (gridArray variable in posterboards/show should not be hardcoded
      but should comprise template variables that are pulled from the DB).
    * Default layout
* Comments    
* Details
   * Timestamps for posterboards
   * Use Amazon S3 to store content such as images, audio, video and retrieve 
     the content properly.
      * Use django plugins to help with this, or their native implementation 
      	that helps interface with S3 and stuff.
   * To preserve privacy, there must be a directory for each user's content,
     rather than a shared one for all content, and this should be hashed,
     with a second level of hashes for the actual posterboard, so as to 
     preserve privacy of private posterboards. Use a secret key hashed with 
     user id and posterboard id.
* Patch vlprocess for pad options (done in our app, pull request?).
* Patch django_cron for syncdb errors (done in our app, pull request?).
