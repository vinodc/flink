Readymade CherryPy static server, for development purposes.

Use this when your Django development server just doesn't cut,
and you're too lazy to install XAMPP/Apache.

I wrote this server when I started working with HTML5 <video>.
I found out that Django's dev server doesn't support byte-range downloads (for progressive downloads and such).
This made the served videos totally unseekable.

So, I wrote this server, and added a URL redirect inside my Django app to serve
all video content through CherryPy (instead of Django) ... and VOILA! Everything worked!

Baking instructions:
1. Install CherryPy: `pip install cherrypy` or `easy_install cherrypy`, and make sure it's installed: `python -c 'import cherrypy'`
2. You can edit the listening URL/port inside the cherrypy_static_server.py file.
3. The root directory is the directory where you executed the script.

Eating instructions:
1. Just execute the file on your shell/terminal: `python cherrypy_static_server.py`
